## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-03

**Upgrading:** this release changes tool names. Fifteen tools were merged into six, so saved prompts, permission allowlists, or scripts naming the old tools need updating — see the table below. No back-compat aliases ship, deliberately: an alias re-sends its schema on every request, which is exactly the cost this change exists to remove. Some tools are also now opt-in and absent unless enabled; if you rely on Scite, duplicate detection, feeds, related-items links, or the corpus-level discovery tools, set `ZOTERO_MCP_TOOLSETS` (below).

### Added
- **`ZOTERO_MCP_TOOLSETS`: optional tool groups, so a session only carries the tools it needs.** Every registered tool is sent to the model on *every* request, so the tool list is a fixed tax on the context window before the user types anything — 62 tools cost roughly 23k tokens, most of which a reading or literature-review session never touches. Optional capabilities now live in named groups (`scite`, `duplicates`, `discovery`, `feeds`, `relations`, `libraries`, `search-admin`, `pdf-geometry`, `chatgpt-connector`) selected by environment variable: unset gives the default profile, `all` restores the previous full surface, `none` is core only, `scite,feeds` adds named groups, and `all,-scite` subtracts them. Anything not named in a group is core and always present, so merging or renaming a core tool never requires touching the registry. An unknown group name fails at startup rather than silently serving a surface nobody asked for. A disabled tool is genuinely absent — not merely hidden — so it cannot be called; groups that pair with core workflows (`libraries`, `search-admin`, `pdf-geometry`) stay on by default for that reason.
- **The ChatGPT connector tools are scoped to the transports that can reach them.** `search` and `fetch` exist to satisfy ChatGPT's deep-research connector contract, which fixes those two generic names. ChatGPT reaches this server over HTTP, never over a stdio subprocess, so the pair now switches on automatically for `streamable-http`/`sse` and off for `stdio` — stdio users stop paying ~690 tokens for two tools they cannot use, and stop having a bare `search` competing with the Zotero search tools for the model's attention. Naming the group explicitly overrides the transport rule in either direction.

### Changed
- **Fifteen tools merged into six; the default surface drops from 62 tools / ~22.9k tokens to 37 / ~13.8k (−40%).** Beyond the token cost, near-duplicate names were a selection hazard: choosing between six `add_by_*` variants, or between `zotero_get_item_children` and `zotero_get_items_children`, is a coin flip the model pays a full round trip to get wrong.

  | Was | Now |
  |---|---|
  | `zotero_add_by_doi`, `add_by_url`, `add_by_isbn`, `add_by_bibtex`, `add_by_csl_json`, `add_from_file` | `zotero_add_item(source=…, source_type="auto")` |
  | `zotero_batch_update_tags`, `zotero_batch_update_extra` | `zotero_batch_update` |
  | `zotero_get_item_children`, `zotero_get_items_children` | `zotero_get_item_children` (one key or many) |
  | `zotero_create_annotation`, `zotero_create_area_annotation` | `zotero_create_annotation` (`rect=` selects area mode) |
  | `zotero_create_note`, `zotero_update_note`, `zotero_delete_note` | `zotero_manage_note(action=…)` |
  | `zotero_search_notes` | `zotero_get_notes(query=…)` |
  | `zotero_manage_collections` | `zotero_set_item_collections` |

- **`zotero_add_item` detects its own source type.** DOI, URL, ISBN, BibTeX, CSL-JSON and file paths are distinguished by inspecting `source`, reusing the existing normalizers rather than new pattern matching; `source_type` overrides when detection would guess wrong. Ordering is deliberate and documented: an `http(s)` URL containing an ISBN stays a URL (only `doi.org` URLs beat the URL branch), and a scheme-less `name.suffix` is only treated as a host when the suffix reads like a TLD, so `notes.txt` is an error rather than a silently-created webpage item.
- **`zotero_update_item` takes a `fields` mapping instead of 28 flat parameters.** Twenty-one of them were simply Zotero field names spelled out in the signature, making it the single most expensive tool at 1,283 tokens; it is now 677. `fields` accepts any Zotero API field name plus `creators`, so it is a superset of what the flat parameters reached, and the delta-semantics parameters that a plain mapping cannot express (`add_tags`, `remove_tags`, `collections`, `collection_names`) stay explicit. An unknown field name now fails with a suggestion and the valid field list for that item type, where before it surfaced as a `TypeError` on the signature.
- **`zotero_create_annotation` takes `rect=[x, y, width, height]` for area mode.** Four separate optional floats measured 683 tokens against 551 for one array, and the array form matches the `bbox` that `zotero_get_page_layout` already reports, so a detected figure region can be passed straight through. All geometry validation — normalized bounds, fit-within-page, finite checks, MediaBox/CropBox mapping — is unchanged.
- **`zotero_manage_collections` is now `zotero_set_item_collections`.** Its parameters were always `item_keys`/`add_to`/`remove_from` — it manages an item's membership *in* collections, not collections themselves, which `zotero_create_collection` and `zotero_delete_collection` do. The old name sat next to those two implying it subsumed them.
- **`zotero_get_item_children` accepts one key or many.** A single key keeps the detailed per-attachment output; several keys keep the compact grouped-by-parent output and the single batched API round trip. Per-key failures are still isolated to their own section rather than aborting the call.

### Fixed
- **Tests run from a git worktree exercised the wrong source tree.** With the package installed in editable mode against the main checkout, `import zotero_mcp` resolved there rather than to the worktree, so a suite run from a worktree silently tested unmodified code and reported green regardless of the edits under review. `tests/conftest.py` now puts its own `src/` first and evicts any already-imported `zotero_mcp` modules.
- **`TOOL_BUDGETS` no longer rots silently.** The description-budget test skips tools it cannot find, which is right for extras-gated tools but meant a renamed or merged tool quietly lost its budget while the suite still reported green. A new check fails when the table names a tool that is no longer registered.
- **Ollama indexing ignored `embedding_config.timeout`, so `update-db` could finish reporting success having written nothing (#423).** The ollama branch of `_create_embedding_function` built `OllamaEmbeddingFunction` with only `model_name` and `base_url`, so a configured timeout was dropped and every request silently used the 120s default — the OpenAI branch beside it forwarded its extra keys correctly. With chunking enabled the mismatch became fatal: each `/api/embed` call carries a whole item batch worth of chunks, which on modest hardware runs well past 120s, so every batch timed out, was queued for end-of-run retry, and the progress bar advanced to completion over an empty database. Reported with a diagnosis and a fix by @physicien, who measured a ~5,600-item library indexing to 163,091 embeddings in 9h34m with 0 errors once the timeout was honored.
- **Ollama requests are now split into `request_batch_size` windows (default 64).** The timeout passthrough above is necessary but treats the symptom: the indexer batches by *item*, and with chunking one item expands to up to `max_chunks_per_item` documents, so a 25-item batch could become thousands of embedding inputs in a single HTTP call — one request that has to outlast the entire GPU pass. The OpenAI embedding function has bounded its requests this way all along; the ollama one sent whatever it was handed. Batches observed taking 13m31s become a series of short calls, so a timeout now bounds one window rather than the whole pass. Configure with `semantic_search.embedding_config.request_batch_size`. A response carrying fewer vectors than inputs is now an error rather than silently shifting every later document onto the wrong embedding.
- **Bibliography and citation rendering works in local-only mode, with no API credentials (#371).** The original fix concluded that Zotero's local API "has no citation engine" and routed all rendering through the web API, so local-only users got an error telling them to configure `ZOTERO_API_KEY`. The real constraint is narrower: `content=bib`/`citation`/`bibtex` implies `format=atom`, and it is *Atom* the local API rejects (501 "Local API does not support Atom output"). Asking the JSON way instead — `include=bib`/`citation` with `style`, or the top-level `format=bibtex` export — is served by the local API with no credentials at all, verified against a live Zotero local API for all three output formats. `zotero_export_bibliography` now uses those parameters in every mode, and the web-only gate is gone. A library-wide export also now draws from top-level items rather than all items, since attachments and notes have no bibliography entry and previously padded the export with blanks. Selections by `item_keys` are additionally filtered client-side: the local API answers an `itemKey` filter on the items endpoint with the requested items *plus* unrelated ones (requesting a single key returned it alongside three others), so trusting the response would have quietly exported the wrong bibliography. The filter also fixes the returned order to the order asked for, and is a no-op against the web API, which filters correctly.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-02

**Upgrading:** new and changed items pick up the improved extraction on the next `zotero-mcp update-db`, but items already in the semantic index are deliberately left alone — they are not re-extracted merely because you upgraded, since that would rebuild an entire library unprompted. To move an existing index onto the better text in one go, run `zotero-mcp update-db --force-rebuild`. Nothing breaks if you don't: those documents keep their existing text and convert as they are touched.

### Added
- **`attachment_priority`: choose which attachment kind fulltext comes from (#378).** An item can hold the publisher PDF, an HTML snapshot, and a Markdown copy the user converted themselves with a dedicated tool — and the PDF always won, so that conversion work was thrown away on every read. `semantic_search.extraction.attachment_priority` now orders the attempt: set `["markdown", "pdf", "html", "other"]` and the converted copy is what gets read and indexed. Valid entries are `pdf`, `html`, `markdown`, `text` and `other`; `other` is a catch-all matching every kind not named elsewhere in the list, so the default `["pdf", "html", "other"]` sweeps Markdown and plain text into one bucket and reproduces the previous behaviour exactly. Omitting `other` means an unlisted kind is never chosen. Unknown entries are dropped with a warning rather than failing the lookup, and a list with nothing usable falls back to the default. This resolves the last hardcoded ordering: both the Web API path (`get_attachment_details`) and the local-storage path now call one chooser in `zotero_mcp.extract` instead of duplicating a bucket-and-sort. Changing the setting marks affected items for re-extraction, so the next `update-db` refreshes text drawn from a now-deprioritized attachment instead of leaving a stale embedding; documents indexed before this field existed are treated as unchanged so nobody's library re-extracts in full merely for upgrading.
- **Passing an attachment key to `zotero_get_item_fulltext` is documented and supported.** Handing the tool an attachment's own key (rather than its parent item's) returns exactly that file and bypasses `attachment_priority` — the way to read one specific attachment of an item that has several, pairing with `zotero_get_item_children` to find the key. This already worked but was undocumented, so callers had no assurance it would keep working; it is now part of the tool's contract and covered by tests (#378).

### Changed
- **PDF text extraction moved to pdf-inspector, behind a single seam.** Text extraction lived in three unrelated places running two engines: the Web API path converted downloads with `markitdown` (pdfminer.six underneath), the local-storage path shelled out to a pdfminer subprocess, and `zotero_read_pdf_pages` called PyMuPDF's `page.get_text()`. None shared a contract, and the two fulltext paths were the two worst engines available — on a 25-page journal article, pdfminer took 1.63s and markitdown 2.39s, both emitting flat text with `(cid:N)` artifacts and no heading structure. Both now go through `zotero_mcp.extract`, backed by [pdf-inspector](https://github.com/firecrawl/pdf-inspector): 0.10s on the same paper, Markdown with real headings, no cid artifacts. `zotero_read_pdf_pages` returns Markdown per page instead of raw text and no longer requires the `[pdf]` extra to run at all. `extract.ExtractedDoc` is the one place page-joined text is assembled, so the form feed that chunk provenance counts to recover a page number is now emitted deterministically rather than being an accident of which engine ran. It also carries pdf-inspector's per-page "no text layer" classification, unused for now, as the routing signal for an OCR backend.
- **`markitdown` is dropped as a dependency; `pdf-inspector` and `markdownify` replace it.** `markitdown` was a core dependency whose own core dependencies include `magika`, which pulls in `onnxruntime` — every install paid for an ONNX runtime to guess file types for a Markdown converter. `pdf-inspector` is MIT, has no Python dependencies, and ships prebuilt abi3 wheels (~2.7 MB) for macOS x86/arm, manylinux x86/aarch64 and Windows; it is pinned exactly while pre-1.0 because its output is user-visible. HTML snapshots now go through `markdownify`, which is what `markitdown` used for HTML anyway, so snapshot conversion is unchanged. PyMuPDF stays in the `[pdf]` extra for annotation coordinates, page layout and PDF outlines.
- **PDF extraction timeouts are gone, along with the machinery built around them.** The 30s watchdog, the `__EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT__` sentinel and its `("timeout")` source channel, the `pdf_timeout` setting, and the indexer's five-consecutive-timeouts circuit breaker all existed because pdfminer was slow and occasionally hung. In-process extraction at ~0.1s per paper needs none of it. Removing the subprocess also retires the UTF-8 stdio forcing for Windows consoles (#286), the API-key scrubbing of the child environment, and the macOS `spawn` deadlock workaround (#178) — three historical bugs that no longer have a place to occur.
- **`fulltext_display_max_pages` now applies in Web API mode too, and no longer inherits the indexing cap.** The page cap for reading a paper inline was only honored on the local-storage path; a download-and-convert fallback returned the whole document regardless of configuration. Both paths now resolve the limit the same way. It also no longer falls back to `pdf_max_pages` when unset: those two caps answer different questions (an agent's context versus the index's recall) and have diverged, so inheriting one for the other would drop dozens of pages of Markdown into a conversation.
- **Local extraction prefers our own parser over `.zotero-ft-cache`.** Zotero writes a plain-text full-text cache beside each indexed attachment, and local mode returned it whenever it existed — on a real 106-item library that was 104 of 106 items, so the extraction upgrade above would have reached almost nobody. The cache is flat `pdftotext` output: no heading structure, and only a third of the files sampled carried page separators at all, meaning chunk provenance had no page number to report. Parsing the file ourselves now comes first, and the same library yields 105 of 106 items parsed, averaging 37 Markdown headings and 25 page separators each. The cache remains the fallback and keeps everything it was good for: it is keyed by attachment key rather than filename, so it still answers when a recorded filename has drifted (#291), when the format is one we don't parse (EPUB), and when a file fails to parse.
- **`pdf_max_pages` defaults to 50 pages, up from 10.** This does not widen what the semantic index sees — that is bounded downstream at roughly 7-8 pages of a typical paper, by either the ~8k-token embedding limit or `chunking.max_chunks_per_item` — so it is headroom for anyone who raises those settings rather than a recall change on its own. It costs almost nothing: pdf-inspector computes font statistics across the whole document before emitting any page, so parse time is per-document rather than per-page, measured at ~380 ms/doc at either cap.

### Fixed
- **`zotero-mcp setup` no longer discards hand-edited extraction settings.** Setup prompts only for `pdf_max_pages` but rewrote the whole `extraction` section, so re-running it silently deleted `fulltext_display_max_pages` and would have deleted `attachment_priority`. It now merges into the existing section.
- **`zotero_search_by_tag` states its scope.** An empty collection-scoped search reported only "No items found with tag: X", which reads as "this tag matches nothing" and invites a retry without `collection_key` — a library-wide search whose results are indistinguishable from scoped ones in the output. The empty message now names the collection that was searched and says what dropping the scope would change, and a library-wide result header says so explicitly instead of staying silent about the absence of a scope (#418).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`update-db --allow-mass-deletion`** — the deletion pass now refuses to remove 25+ documents amounting to 25%+ of the syncing library's indexed documents in one run, a fingerprint far more likely to be a truncated `item_versions()` response or a sync-scoping regression than a real purge. Intentional purges (including emptying a library outright) opt in with this flag for a single run. It is deliberately a CLI flag rather than an environment variable, so no persisted configuration can disable the guard and the MCP server's unattended background sync can never mass-delete. A run whose deletion pass was skipped (guard, failed or empty `item_versions()`) does not promote the sync watermark, so the rerun actually re-enters deletion detection instead of hitting the unchanged-version early exit. The same opt-in now also gates `--force-rebuild` when the collection holds documents not attributed to the active library (a reset destroys the whole collection but repopulates only the active library) and the `--force-rebuild --limit N` combination.
- **Structured JSON annotation export.** `zotero_get_annotations(format="json")` returns normalized annotation records with paper and attachment keys, page metadata, text, comments, color, tags, timestamps, and source. `zotero_synthesize_annotations(format="json")` returns the same records grouped by paper alongside structured notes and summary counts. The standalone CLI exposes this as `zotero-cli annotations list --format json` (#215). Records are normalized across all three annotation sources: `page` is always the page label, `page_index` always 0-based (Better BibTeX and direct PDF extraction report 1-based pages internally), and `color_category` is derived for every source rather than only the Better BibTeX one.

### Changed
- **`fastmcp` is pinned to `<4`, and `httpx` is now a declared dependency.** FastMCP 4 (currently `4.0.0b1`) targets the stateless `2026-07-28` MCP revision and is a breaking upgrade for this server: it removes `ctx.sample()`/`ctx.list_roots()`/`ctx.elicit()`, raises the `pydantic` floor to 2.12, and replaces `httpx` with `httpx2` throughout. That last change is the reason `httpx` moves into the dependency list — `client.py` imports it directly for the HTTP/1.1-pinned local Zotero transport, and until now relied on it arriving transitively through FastMCP. The CI test job installed `fastmcp` unpinned, so it would have picked up the 4.0 stable release on its next scheduled run and failed without a commit to this repo; it is pinned to match. The `mcp` dependency is dropped: nothing in `src/` imports it, and FastMCP already pins the SDK version it needs. The FastMCP 4 migration is tracked separately and will not ship until 4.0 leaves beta.
- `zotero_synthesize_annotations` groups its digest by item key instead of by title, so two distinct papers that share a title are no longer merged into one section. Markdown headings are qualified with the item key when a title collides.

### Fixed
- **`zotero_advanced_search` sorting works, and says so when it cannot.** Sorting by `date` ordered results by *month name*: Zotero's `data["date"]` is a display string ("October 1, 2016"), and it was compared lexically, so October preceded March preceded January regardless of year. Date sorts now use the API's normalized `meta.parsedDate`, falling back to the first four-digit year in the display string for sparse records that carry no `parsedDate`. Separately, a sort field absent from every result — misspelled, or simply not present in that backend's item shape — sorted every key to the empty string, leaving results in library order while reporting nothing; the tool now says the sort was not applied and names the sortable fields instead of returning a silently unsorted list (#418).
- **`zotero_advanced_search` honors `collection` conditions.** The condition was advertised in the tool description but could never match: an item's membership is stored in `data["collections"]` (a list of collection keys), and extraction read a `data["collection"]` that does not exist, so every collection condition compared the empty string against the requested key. Any query containing one returned "No items found", including queries whose other conditions matched hundreds of items. Membership is now read from the right field, an item filed in several collections matches on any of them, and an item in no collection correctly satisfies `isNot`. `collections` is accepted as a spelling of the same field. Scoping is direct membership, matching Zotero's own "Collection is X" with subcollections not included. This was never mode-specific — `advanced_search` filters client-side on every backend, so the condition was equally broken against the web API (#418).
- **`zotero_update_item` writes fields that a type stores under a renamed key.** Several Zotero item types keep a *base* field under a type-specific key — a statute's title is `nameOfAct`, a case's is `caseName`, a statute's date is `dateEnacted` — but the update path gated each field on whether the key was already present on the fetched item, using instance presence as a proxy for type validity. Setting `title` on a statute therefore did nothing and was reported as a skipped field, and the same held for every other base-field rename. Each generic parameter is now resolved to the type's actual field and validated against that type's declared field set, so a field that is valid but simply absent from the record is written rather than false-skipped (`place` on a journal article and `accessDate` on a book were both being refused this way). The mapping is a trimmed slice of Zotero's global `/schema` document vendored with the package, refreshed weekly in the background and on demand with `zotero-mcp schema-refresh` — the vendored copy is the floor, so resolution is correct offline and for local-only installs, and only item types Zotero adds after a release need the refresh. The `citationKey` special case from #321 is retired: it is an ordinary schema field and now validates like one (#402). The background refresh backs off for a day after a failure rather than retrying on every startup, and `ZOTERO_MCP_SCHEMA_REFRESH=0` declines the network call outright — the vendored table is always a correct floor, so the only cost is not picking up item types Zotero adds after a release (#402).
- **Syncing one library no longer deletes every other library's documents from the semantic index (#404).** The incremental deletion pass diffed *every* stored id against `item_versions()` of the *active* library, so the first incremental sync after multi-library indexing became possible treated all other libraries' documents as "no longer present in Zotero" and deleted them. Confirmed in the wild: a single `update-db` run removed 833 documents, 738 of them live group-library items — essentially the entire group portion of a multi-library index. Deletion candidates are now fetched DB-side with a `where={"group_id": …}` filter for the syncing library only, so another library's documents — and documents with no attribution at all — are structurally out of the pass's reach. Two failure modes that used to read as "the library is empty" now skip deletion instead of wiping: `item_versions()` raising (it previously degraded to an empty dict, turning a transient API failure into a full wipe of everything in scope) and `item_versions()` succeeding with an empty body against a non-empty index. The library identity a run tags, watermarks and deletes under is pinned once per run from the run's own Zotero client, so a concurrent `zotero_switch_library` can no longer re-point half an update at another library.
- **The multi-library `group_id` backfill actually runs — it called methods that did not exist.** `_backfill_group_ids()` has invoked `ChromaClient.iter_metadatas()` and `update_metadatas()` since #396, but only the test suite's fakes defined them; the real class never did, so every production backfill died with `AttributeError`, no pre-existing document was ever tagged, and `zotero_semantic_search(library_id=…)` silently matched nothing on migrated indexes. The real methods exist now (id-snapshot paging and batch-split updates, per the #368/#369 precedents), regression tests run against the real `ChromaClient`, and a conformance test auto-discovers every Chroma-shaped fake in the suite and pins it to the real API so a fake-only method can never go green in CI again. The backfill's attribution also stopped guessing: a document is tagged only on positive evidence (the local database's key→group map, trashed items included so each library's own scoped pass cleans its trash, or membership in the active library's `item_versions()`), and documents with no evidence stay untagged — excluded from library-filtered search and, deliberately, from deletion. The failure log no longer recommends `--force-rebuild` as the repair: a rebuild re-embeds the whole collection and permanently drops any documents the current ingest paths cannot recreate. Users who already followed that advice have a freshly built, fully tagged index and need no action.
- **OpenAI Batch API imports no longer fail on large libraries.** `ChromaClient.upsert_documents` already split upserts into chunks of `client.get_max_batch_size()` to stay under ChromaDB's batch limit, but `upsert_embeddings` — the method the batch-import path uses to write precomputed vectors — upserted the whole payload in a single call, so any import larger than ChromaDB's `max_batch_size` (~5461) failed outright (e.g. "Batch size of 6312 is greater than max batch size of 5461"). `upsert_embeddings` now chunks the same way (#410).

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Listed in the official MCP Registry** (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) as `io.github.54yyyu/zotero-mcp`. A `server.json` at the repo root describes the PyPI package, its stdio transport, and the four env vars a client needs to prompt for (`ZOTERO_LOCAL`, `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`, `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_TYPE`); ownership is proven by the `mcp-name:` marker in the README, which is what PyPI serves as the package description. The release workflow republishes on every tag via GitHub OIDC, so the registry version can't drift from PyPI. Registry clients install by the distribution name rather than the console-script name, so `zotero-mcp-server` is now also a console-script alias for `zotero-mcp` and `uvx zotero-mcp-server serve` works without `--from`.

### Fixed
- **`zotero-mcp update` no longer offers, or performs, a downgrade.** The check was `current_version != latest_version`, so any install ahead of the last PyPI release — every git checkout and dev build — was told an update was available, and running it replaced the newer code with the older release. Ordering is now compared rather than inequality, via `packaging.version.Version` where available and a numeric-tuple fallback where it isn't (`packaging` is not a declared dependency, only a common transitive one). Being ahead is reported as such instead of as a bare "already up to date", and `--force` from an ahead version warns before downgrading. As a side effect the comparison is numeric rather than lexical, so `0.10.0` is correctly newer than `0.9.0`.
- **Linked-file attachments are readable in local mode.** `download_attachment_file` started at `zot.dump()`, and for a *linked* attachment Zotero's local API answers `/file` with a 302 to a `file://` URL that httpx refuses to follow ("unsupported protocol"). A linked file is by definition never uploaded to WebDAV or Zotero storage either, so all three remaining sources failed on a file sitting readable on the same disk. The attachment path is now resolved out of `zotero.sqlite` first, which also spares ordinary stored files an API round trip. `zotero_get_annotations` was the visible casualty — unlike the fulltext and `read_pdf` paths it had no local-database step in front of the downloader — and its "linked attachments cannot be accessed remotely" error now points at `ZOTERO_LOCAL=true` instead, since that is the condition under which they do work. The resolved file is copied rather than handed back by path: callers treat the result as scratch and delete it, which on a linked file would have destroyed the user's original (the `_cleanup_path` failure mode from #372).

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **`zotero_attach_file`** — attaches a local file or a direct PDF URL to an *existing* item, the gap that `zotero_add_from_file` (which always creates a new item) left open. Idempotent on both stored filename and content hash, so re-running converges instead of accumulating duplicate attachments, and the created attachment's key is returned so follow-up calls don't need a `get_item_children` round trip (#377, #386).
- **Multi-library tagging in the semantic search index (#163, phase 1)** — ChromaDB documents are now tagged with a `group_id` field (0 = personal library, else the Zotero groupID — the same `0`/groupID convention already used by `zotero_switch_library`). `zotero_semantic_search` gains a `library_id` parameter (accepting `0`, `"user"`, or a group's numeric groupID; omitted to search every indexed library — the new default) that filters on `group_id` DB-side via a ChromaDB `where` clause, never a Python post-filter. Existing collections are migrated automatically on the next `zotero_update_search_database` run (metadata-only backfill, no re-embedding, no downtime). Note: full item enrichment for a search hit still uses the currently active library's client, so a hit from a group library other than the active one may show limited detail until that capability lands in a follow-up; the incremental-update deletion pass is likewise not yet scoped per library (#404) (#396).
- **Multi-flavor Docker images published to GHCR** — `core` and `all` flavors built multi-arch on tags and `main`, with a container entrypoint supporting both MCP server mode and standalone CLI mode (`ZOTERO_APP=cli`). Documented container env vars and the ChromaDB/config persistence mount path in the README and `docs/docker-images.md` (#332).
- **Top-level `zotero_db_path` config setting**, with `semantic_search.zotero_db_path` still honored as a fallback. Config parsing moved to a typed, Pydantic-validated `zotero_mcp/config.py`: unknown keys are ignored, null nested objects fall back to defaults, and a malformed config logs a warning rather than crashing (#367).

### Fixed
- **Failed file uploads are no longer reported as successes.** pyzotero's `attachment_both()` signals a client-side rejection by returning the payload in its `failure` list rather than raising, and every attach site guarded only against exceptions — so a file that never landed was reported as "File attached" / "PDF attached". This was the shared root cause behind the silent-attach reports in #278, #306 and #399. Every attach path now verifies that an attachment was actually registered, retries through a create-then-upload flow that confirms the stored `md5`, and deletes the orphaned attachment shell if the upload still fails. Uploading through a local-only client now fails immediately with a clear message instead of a 404 from `localhost:23119`, which has no attachment endpoints (#403).
- **`children()` calls are paginated everywhere.** pyzotero's `children()` is an unpaginated passthrough, so without an explicit limit the Zotero API returns its default page of 25 and every call site silently operated on at most the first 25 children. Worst case was in `merge_duplicates`: only the first ≤25 children of each duplicate were re-parented onto the keeper and the rest went to the Trash with the duplicate item, in the operation users most expect to be conservative. Also fixed truncated results in semantic-search fulltext fetching, `get_attachment_details`, annotation extraction, item children listings and `zotero_library_coverage` (#387).
- **The semantic-search sync watermark is now per library.** A single `last_sync_version` scalar was compared against whichever library was active, so switching with `zotero_switch_library` and updating the database compared one library's version counter against another's and then overwrote it, corrupting sync state for both. Watermarks are stored per library under `last_sync_versions`, keyed by group_id. Existing configs migrate: the old scalar is kept for the env-configured default library (the only library it could have been tracking across restarts) and discarded if a runtime library override is active, since its provenance is then unknowable. A watermark ahead of the library's current version now triggers a full scan rather than a `since=` query that returns nothing (#393).
- **`zotero_get_pdf_outline` no longer takes the whole MCP server down.** `fitz.Document.get_toc()` segfaults on some born-digital journal PDFs; a segfault cannot be caught in-process, so the server died with it ("Server disconnected") and left orphaned processes behind. The outline is now read in a short-lived child process with a timeout — a crash or hang comes back as a plain error message and the server keeps running. The download also moved from the legacy `zot.dump()` call to the shared multi-source downloader, so WebDAV- and local-storage-backed attachments work, and a key naming the PDF attachment itself is accepted (#372).
- **`zotero_read_pdf_pages` accepts a PDF attachment key**, as its description always claimed. It previously scanned the key's children for a PDF — an attachment has none — and answered "No PDF attachment found" for the very item that *was* the PDF. The local reader gained `get_attachment_by_key()` for this, since attachments are invisible to the item-level lookup (#372).
- **Ollama semantic search works at query time.** zotero-mcp's `OllamaEmbeddingFunction` registers with ChromaDB under the name `ollama`, colliding with chromadb's own built-in of that name; when chromadb rebuilt the embedding function from the persisted collection config at query time, the built-in could win and reject our config with "This code should not be reached in query" — even though indexing had just succeeded. The persisted config now carries the keys both classes need, `build_from_config` accepts either spelling, and our classes are re-registered immediately before a collection is opened so a late import can't shadow them. The same treatment was applied to the `openai` and `huggingface` registrations (#382).
- **`zotero_export_bibliography` works in local and hybrid mode.** Rendering was routed to whichever client was active, and Zotero's local API has no CSL engine, so it failed with "Local API does not support Atom output". Bibliography and citation rendering now goes through the web API whenever credentials are configured (with the active library override applied, so a switched-to group library is targeted), and local-only mode returns an actionable message instead (#371).
- **Annotation tags are returned by `zotero_get_annotations`.** Two extraction paths hardcoded an empty tag list, and the Better BibTeX path dropped tags one layer further down in `process_annotation()`. Tag shapes from all sources are normalized, so a loose shape can no longer turn into an error (#377).
- **`db-inspect --stats` and `--filter` work on very large collections.** `--stats` issued one unbounded `col.get()`, which exceeds SQLite's bound-variable ceiling past a few tens of thousands of rows ("too many SQL variables"). `--filter` applied `--limit` to the raw fetch instead of to matches, so it only ever scanned the first N records in storage order and reported "No records matched your filter" for terms that were plainly present. Both now stream the collection in fixed-size batches with flat memory use (#368, #384).
- **Setup writes the Claude Desktop config where Claude Desktop actually reads it.** Some builds keep it in `Claude-3p` rather than `Claude` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows, and the same directory name on macOS and Linux), so setup reported success against a file the running app never read. Every known location is probed, all existing configs are written rather than just the first match, and the absolute path(s) written are always printed. Reading the config back for environment variables had the same first-match-wins problem and now scans all of them (#392).
- **Attachments upload to WebDAV directly when WebDAV is configured**, instead of being pushed to Zotero cloud storage first — which is the wrong target for those users and fails with HTTP 413 once the free 300 MB quota is full. If the WebDAV PUT fails after the attachment item was created, the orphaned item is deleted rather than left behind with no file bytes (#361).
- **`zotero_db_path` is honored by every local-mode tool.** `list_libraries`, `validate_library_switch`, `list_feeds`, `get_feed_items`, `read_pdf`, `get_item_fulltext` and `get_attachment_path` ignored the configured path and relied on auto-detection, so they read the wrong database for anyone with a non-default Zotero profile location (#367).
- **The BibTeX fallback emits ISBN and ISSN.** When Better BibTeX isn't reachable, the hand-rolled builder omitted both, so books and journal articles lost identifiers the underlying record carried (#398).
- **`zotero_read_pdf_pages` no longer risks deleting files it doesn't own.** Its cleanup step removes the *parent directory* of the PDF it worked on, guarded only by a `startswith(tempfile.gettempdir())` check. That guard is too loose in both directions: on Linux `gettempdir()` is `/tmp`, so a path like `/tmp/paper.pdf` has `/tmp` as its parent and passes, and the tool also ran cleanup on files resolved out of the user's own Zotero storage. Cleanup is now restricted to directories this tool created (`zotero_pdf_` prefix, strictly below the temp root), and a file resolved from local storage is never passed to it. Found because it wiped the CI runner's temp directory mid-suite, which had also been misattributed to an unrelated PR.
- **Install hints match how zotero-mcp was actually installed.** Runtime "install the extra" errors hardcoded a `pip install` command, which silently does nothing useful for `uv tool` and pipx installs. The flavor is detected from the package's own path and only working commands are shown; when it can't be determined, all three are listed (#388).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Opt-in collection filter for the semantic search database** — set `semantic_search.collection_keys` in `config.json` to build the vector database from only those collections (subcollections included, resolved recursively) instead of the whole library. Unset, behavior is unchanged (#370).

### Fixed
- **Chunking no longer forces a full re-extract and re-embed of the whole library on every update.** With `semantic_search.chunking` enabled (#350), items are indexed only under their chunk ids (`<key>#<n>`), but the "already indexed?" check in the local-fulltext path looked each item up by its bare key. That exact-id lookup never matched, so every item counted as new: each fulltext update re-extracted every PDF and re-embedded the entire library, silently and without an error. `get_document_metadata` now falls back to chunk 0, which carries the item-level `date_modified` and `has_fulltext` that the check needs, so unchanged items are skipped again (#380).
- **Local database auto-discovery now honors a custom Zotero data directory** — the `extensions.zotero.dataDir` preference is read from the Zotero profile's `prefs.js` (macOS/Windows/Linux), so relocated data directories no longer fail with "Zotero database not found at ~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite" (#68). The `ZOTERO_DB_PATH` environment variable, documented in the README but previously unimplemented, now works as an override, and the not-found error lists every location checked plus how to fix it. `extensions.zotero.baseAttachmentPath` is likewise read from the profile's `prefs.js`, fixing resolution of linked attachments relative to a base directory (#379).
- **Items whose full-text extraction once failed are retried when their attachments change** — attaching a PDF later doesn't bump the parent's `dateModified`, so items first indexed metadata-only were permanently locked out of full-text indexing. The local-mode scan now records each item's attachment-key set and retries when it changes; legacy "failed" records retry once and converge (#373).
- **ChromaDB upserts are split to the backend's max batch size** — with chunking enabled, a batch of long documents could exceed ChromaDB's `max_batch_size` (~5,461), failing the whole batch and degrading the retry pass to one-record-at-a-time upserts (#369).
- **Created annotations land in the right place on PDFs with a non-zero page box origin** — highlight rectangles were written in PyMuPDF's CropBox-normalized space, but Zotero positions annotations in native PDF user space (MediaBox origin). Rects (and the derived sort index) are now mapped through the page's inverse transformation matrix, which also handles page rotation (#381).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **`zotero_get_search_database_status` no longer reports "0 documents / not initialized" against a populated database** — ChromaDB ≥1.x's embedding-function conflict check rejected the status reader's no-op embedding function; it now identifies as `"default"`, which short-circuits the check for any persisted backend (#362, #364).
- **Semantic search with the reranker enabled no longer times out** — the cross-encoder was reloaded from disk on every request (~30s per call); it is now cached process-wide and warmed up in the background at server start, so reranked searches are sub-second after the first load (#283, #365).
- **Ollama embeddings now use the current `/api/embed` endpoint** instead of the deprecated `/api/embeddings` route. The whole batch is sent in a single request (`input`) rather than one request per document, and the response's `embeddings` list is parsed accordingly (#349, #360).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Passage-level chunking for semantic search** (opt-in via `semantic_search.chunking`) — each item is indexed as overlapping passages with char/page provenance, so search returns a grounded snippet and long PDFs stay searchable past the single-vector truncation limit. Off by default; enabling it needs a one-time `update-db --force-rebuild` (#350).
- **Agentic research tools** (#350):
  - `zotero_find_related_papers` — walks the OpenAlex citation graph (references + citing works) and flags each result as already-in-library or a gap.
  - `zotero_library_coverage` — audits which items lack a PDF, with DOIs ready for the OA download cascade.
  - `zotero_synthesize_annotations` — per-paper digest of highlights and notes.
  - `zotero_export_bibliography` — CSL-rendered bibliography / citations / BibTeX via Zotero's own engine.
- **MCP prompts and resources** — `literature_review`, `synthesize_my_notes`, `find_contradicting_evidence`, `expand_from_paper`; resources `zotero://collections`, `zotero://items/{key}`, `zotero://collections/{key}/items` (#350).
- **`zotero_batch_update_extra`** — batch upsert/remove of `Key: value` lines in the Extra field across many items (#232, #334).
- **Collection resolution in all add paths** — collection specs (key, name, or parent/child path) are resolved and validated across every add path and `manage_collections`; an unknown or ambiguous spec fails the add early with suggestions instead of leaving an unfiled item (#336, #340).
- **Idempotent adds** — `if_exists=duplicate|file|skip`: re-adding converges (files into missing collections, adds missing tags) instead of duplicating. MCP default stays `duplicate`; the CLI defaults to `file` (#337, #341).
- **`zotero-cli add isbn|bibtex|csl-json` subcommands**, with stdin via `-` (#338, #342).
- **Ollama embedding backend** for semantic search (`nomic-embed-text`, `bge-m3`) (#349).
- **OpenAI Batch API embedding indexing** — submit / status / import async embedding jobs for cheaper large-library indexing (#346).
- **OpenAI embedding sub-batching and rate limiting** — `embedding_config.request_batch_size` (default 64, for stricter OpenAI-compatible providers) and an optional `embedding_config.rate_limit_rps` per-request throttle for 429 safety (#261, #307, #356).
- **`citation_key` on `zotero_update_item`** — writes the native `citationKey` field (#320, #321).
- **`ZOTERO_WEBDAV_TIMEOUT`** env var to tune the WebDAV upload read timeout (#344, #345).
- Standalone PDF attachments now surface in `zotero_get_collection_items` (#224).

### Fixed
- Incremental semantic sync no longer advances the watermark when the immutable sqlite snapshot lags the live API (un-checkpointed WAL), which previously made newly-added items be skipped permanently (#292, #333).
- `update-db --fulltext` no longer caps each item at a single truncated vector; passage chunking indexes full text past the embedding limit (#290).
- `zotero-cli add file` no longer raises `TypeError` from a phantom `parent_key`; exposes `--title` / `--item-type` (#335, #339).
- `zotero_read_pdf_pages` routes through the shared multi-source download (local → WebDAV → cloud), so WebDAV-backed PDFs work (#351).
- Scite reaches the `/papers` endpoint correctly — it now sends a bare JSON array instead of a `{"dois": [...]}` object (which returned HTTP 400 and broke retraction checks), and matches Scite's lowercased DOI keys so uppercase DOIs (e.g. `10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0`) aren't missed (#331).
- Semantic search reliability: deterministic embeddings via explicit `encoding_format="float"` (fixes intermittent OpenRouter/Gemini "No embedding data received"); `db-status` no longer loads an embedding model or holds the global API lock (#348).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **`zotero_get_page_layout` tool** — detect figure/table regions on a PDF page with bounding boxes and caption association, for coordinate-grounded reading (#312).
- **`zotero_add_by_bibtex`** — ingest one or more items from a BibTeX string OR a `.bib`/`.bibtex` file path; parses via `bibtexparser` (with LaTeX→unicode conversion), maps to Zotero item format, preserves the citation key in Extra, and attempts an open-access PDF attachment when a DOI is present (#241).
- **`zotero_add_by_csl_json`** — same for CSL JSON input from an inline string/object/array OR a `.json`/`.csljson` file path. The CSL `id` is preserved in Extra as the citation key (#241).
- New `citation_import` module — BibTeX parsing, CSL JSON coercion, and the shared field/type crosswalk (reference: <https://aurimasv.github.io/z2csl/typeMap.xml>).
- **`zotero_read_pdf_pages` tool** — read a specific page range from a PDF attachment after section identification via `zotero_get_pdf_outline`. Extracts text from the requested pages using PyMuPDF, avoiding the need to read the entire paper when only a few pages are relevant.
- RSS feed items now surface their publication date (and DOI) (#316).

### Changed
- Bumped the `pyzotero` floor to `>=1.8.0` — the first release accepting the custom HTTP/1.1 `client=` used by the local-API fix; older `1.6.x`/`1.7.x` crashed every tool call with `TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'client'` (#322).
- Bumped the `[semantic]` extra's `chromadb` floor to `>=1.0.0` for `register_embedding_function`, introduced in chromadb 1.0.0 (#324).
- New base dependency: `bibtexparser>=1.4,<2`.

### Fixed
- `zotero_search_by_citation_key` now matches the native `citationKey` field, not just the `Extra` fallback (#319).
- Custom OpenAI/Gemini/HuggingFace embedding functions are registered with ChromaDB's registry so a persisted database reloads correctly (#315).
- Bounded the global Zotero API lock so a stuck operation can't wedge every tool with opaque `-32001` timeouts (#311).
- `zotero_add_by_url` arXiv path is resilient to arXiv outages via a CrossRef fallback (#310).
- `zotero_add_by_doi` and arXiv PDF uploads now honor `ZOTERO_WEBDAV_*` instead of always going to Zotero cloud storage (#314, #313).
- Strip the pyzotero-rejected `lastRead` field on attachment updates, fixing `zotero_update_item` failures on attachments opened in Zotero's PDF reader (#318, #317).

### Security
- **SSRF guard on the open-access PDF download path** — the OA-PDF URL comes from third-party metadata APIs (Unpaywall / Semantic Scholar) and was previously fetched with no scheme/host validation and default redirect-following. It is now validated against a public-host allowlist (rejecting loopback / link-local / RFC1918 / cloud-metadata) with per-redirect-hop re-checking (#327, #326).
- **Credential-hygiene + DoS hardening**: mask `ZOTERO_API_KEY` in `setup --no-claude` output by default (`--show-secrets` to opt in); write credential config files with `0o600`; prefer the env var / `getpass` over the `--api-key` flag; add a subprocess timeout to `pdfannots2json`; run the Docker image as a non-root user (#328, #326).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Scite citation intelligence integration** — the MCP counterpart of the [Scite Zotero Plugin](https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin). New optional `[scite]` extra that enriches Zotero library items with citation data from [scite.ai](https://scite.ai). No Scite account required (#180).
  - `scite_enrich_item`: Get citation tallies (supporting/contrasting/mentioning) and editorial notice alerts for any paper by DOI or Zotero item key.
  - `scite_enrich_search`: Search your Zotero library and see Scite tallies and retraction alerts inline with each result.
  - `scite_check_retractions`: Scan your library (by collection, tag, or recent items) for retractions, corrections, and other editorial notices.
- New `scite_client.py` module: thin HTTP client for `api.scite.ai` public endpoints (tallies, paper metadata, editorial notices).

### Fixed
- **macOS PDF extraction deadlock** — replaced `multiprocessing.Process` with `subprocess.run` to prevent FastMCP re-initialization in child process (#178, #173, #181).
- **Deleted items indexed in semantic search** — excluded trashed items from `get_items_with_text()` and `get_item_count()` (#175).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **`create_annotation` crash** — fixed `_client._client.` double-indirection typo introduced in v0.2.0 refactor (#168).
- **`attachments:` path resolution** — now reads `baseAttachmentPath` from Zotero's `prefs.js` instead of wrongly resolving against the storage directory (#169).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Architecture
- **Split `server.py` (4,800 lines) into `tools/` subpackage** — search, retrieval, annotations, write, connectors, and shared helpers are now separate modules. `server.py` is a 109-line re-export shim.
- **Removed `_ServerModule` sys.modules hack** — tool modules use module-level attribute access; tests patch canonical locations directly.
- **Optional dependency groups** — `[semantic]` (ChromaDB, embeddings), `[pdf]` (PyMuPDF, EPUB), `[all]`. Base install is lightweight with no ML dependencies.

### Refactored
- Deduplicated 7 item-formatting functions into single `format_item_result()` with configurable abstract length, tags, and extra fields.
- Extracted `_normalize_limit()` helper replacing 12 copy-pasted `isinstance(limit, str)` blocks.
- Consolidated duplicate `suppress_stdout()` into `utils.py`.
- Merged `_strip_xml_tags()` into `clean_html()` with `collapse_whitespace` parameter.
- Extended `format_creators()` to handle string creators; `_format_bbt_result()` now delegates to it.
- Collapsed `get_annotations`/`_get_annotations` wrapper into single function.
- Modernized typing in 5 modules: `Optional[X]` → `X | None`, `Dict` → `dict`, `List` → `list`.
- Removed dead code: unused `_extract_item_key_from_input()` function, stale typing imports across 7 modules.

### Fixed
- **Stale embedding model detection** — ChromaDB collections created with a deprecated model (e.g., `text-embedding-004`) are now auto-detected and recreated on startup.
- **Bare `except:` clauses** — replaced with specific exception types in `better_bibtex_client.py`.
- **PDF outline import order** — defers PyMuPDF import until after attachment check.
- **Suppressed noisy pdfminer warnings** during PDF text extraction.

### Docs
- README documents optional extras (`[semantic]`, `[pdf]`, `[all]`), write operations, and embedding model troubleshooting.
- Removed stale fork enhancements section.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Write operations** — 10+ new tools: `create_item`, `update_item`, `create_note`, `add_tags`, `batch_update_tags`, `create_collection`, `add_to_collection`, `remove_from_collection`, `add_by_doi`, `add_by_url`, `add_from_file` (PR #165).
- **BetterBibTeX citation key lookup** — `search_by_citation_key` searches both BetterBibTeX JSON-RPC and the Extra field (#72).
- **PDF outline extraction** — `get_pdf_outline` returns table of contents from PDFs.
- **Annotation page labels** — `get_annotations` now includes `annotationPageLabel` and `annotationPosition` data (#159).
- **PDF timeout** — configurable `pdf_timeout` (default 30s) skips slow PDFs during fulltext extraction (#74).
- **Semantic search quality** — combined field+fulltext embeddings, Gemini `retrieval_query`/`retrieval_document` fix, model-aware tokenizer, optional cross-encoder re-ranking (PR #154).
- **Abstracts in collection items** — `get_collection_items` now includes abstracts (#143).
- **Local-first fulltext extraction** — prefers local DB/storage before remote `dump()` for file-backed attachments (PR #166).
- **`--fulltext` guard** — aborts with clear error when used without `ZOTERO_LOCAL` enabled (PR #156).

### Fixed
- **search_notes** — fixed `qmode` and client-side filter to actually find notes (#137).
- **batch_update_tags** — fixed stale tag set, response type check, and added hybrid local+web mode (#162).
- **get_tags pagination** — uses `zot.everything()` for reliable tag retrieval (#70).
- **Fulltext truncation** — removed hardcoded 10k/5k char caps; model-aware truncation via `embedding_max_tokens` (#153, #134).
- **Local mode file:// paths** — resolves `file://`, absolute paths, and `attachments:` prefixes (#116).
- **Child notes** — `create_note` properly attaches as child via web API in local mode (#133).
- **ChromaDB embedding conflict** — auto-detects and resets collection on model change (#109).
- **FastMCP compatibility** — removed deprecated `dependencies` parameter (#117, #61).
- **PDF outline import order** — defers PyMuPDF import until after attachment check.
- **Update interval display** — fixed misleading display for daily schedule (PR #144).
- **Config loading** — embedding model config now loads correctly from config file (#76).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Model-aware token truncation for embedding models.

### Fixed

- Auto-reset ChromaDB collection on embedding model change.
- Updated default Gemini model to `gemini-embedding-001`.
- Implemented `get_config`/`build_from_config` for ChromaDB embedding functions.
- Fixed test `FakeChromaClient` missing `embedding_max_tokens` attribute.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-20
