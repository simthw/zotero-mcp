"""MCP prompts: reusable research workflows over the Zotero tools.

Importing this module registers each ``@mcp.prompt`` with the FastMCP app (a
side effect, mirroring the tool modules). Prompts are surfaced by MCP hosts as
slash-commands/templates the user can invoke; each returns a plain instruction
string that steers the assistant to chain the Zotero tools in a sensible order.

These are intentionally dependency-free and never touch the Zotero API at
import time, so they load in any environment.
